Hello ðŸ‘‹

I have been learning full stack Web3 Development including Python, Solidity, and JavaScript. My primary skillset remains on the back-end with SQL & Python Database Applications and trading tools. I also have created various discord bots, but I enjoy taking on any challenges that need development.

### I. [Discord Stock Chart Bot](W3bzee/stockPlotDiscordBot) 	:chart_with_upwards_trend:
When the bot is online, it will monitor for !commands and output the 1 month OHLC chart, along with the current price of the stock. Outputs the charts in a local /charts folder.
