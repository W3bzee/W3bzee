Hello, thanks for stopping in 👋

My name is ✨W3bzee✨, it is nice to meet you! I have been learning full stack Web3 Development including but not limited to Solidity, Python and JavaScript. My primary skillset remains on the back-end including NFT contract deployment and trading tools. I also have established various discord bots and servers, but I enjoy taking on any challenges that need development.

### I. [Discord Stock Chart Bot](W3bzee/stockPlotDiscordBot) 	:chart_with_upwards_trend:
When the bot is online, it will monitor for !commands and output the 1 month OHLC chart, along with the current price of the stock. Outputs the charts in a local /charts folder.
