Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is âœ¨W3bzeeâœ¨, it is nice to meet you! I have been learning full stack Web3 Development including but not limited to Solidity, Python and JavaScript. My primary skillset remains on the back-end including NFT contract deployment and trading tools. I also have established various discord bots and servers, but I enjoy taking on any challenges that need development.
